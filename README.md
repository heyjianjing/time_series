# Some time series algorithms

`ts_01`
* Bias and variance of estimator
* Distribution and likelihood function
* Maximum likelihood estimator
* Mean squared error (MSE) of estimator
* Bayesian MSE and its optimizer
* State space tracking
* Markov property
* Joint Bayesian recursion
* Marginal Bayesian recursion with numerical integration
* **Example**: 1D single mode and multi-mode tracking of state

`ts_02`
* Monte Carlo (MC) integration
* Importance sampling
* Impulse (particle) representation of distribution
* MC integration as Schwartz distribution acts on test function
* Approximate posterior density with particles
* Recursion for importance density and weights
* Sequential importance sampling (SIS)
* Effective particle number and degeneracy problem
* **Example**: 1D single mode and multi-mode tracking of state
* **Example**: Particle resampling
* **Example**: Joint estimation of state, model parameters, and noise

`ts_03`
* Online changepoint detection
* Run length posterior
* Changepoint prior
* Conjugate models
* Exponential family
* Recursion for Gaussian conjugate prior
* **Example**: Gaussian with changing mean and fixed variance
* Recursion for Gaussian-gamma conjugate prior
* **Example**: Gaussian with changing mean and variance
